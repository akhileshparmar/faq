# Callback vs Promises

### Comparing Callbacks and Promises

| Feature            | Callbacks                                  | Promises                                                     |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Readability**    | Can lead to "callback hell"                | More readable with `.then()`, `.catch()`, and async/await    |
| **Error Handling** | Inconsistent and can be cumbersome         | Consistent and easier with `.catch()` and `.finally()`       |
| **Control Flow**   | Inversion of control                       | More control over execution flow                             |
| **Composability**  | Hard to compose multiple async operations  | Easy to compose with `Promise.all()`, `Promise.race()`, etc. |
| **Syntax**         | Simple and straightforward for basic cases | Cleaner and more readable for complex cases                  |
| **Learning Curve** | Easy to start with, but can become complex | Steeper learning curve, but leads to better structure        |

### Summary

- **Callbacks** are simple and flexible but can lead to callback hell and have inconsistent error handling.
- **Promises** provide a more structured and readable way to handle asynchronous code, with better error handling and composability, at the cost of increased complexity and a steeper learning curve.

Using promises (especially with async/await) is generally recommended for handling asynchronous operations in modern JavaScript code due to their readability and maintainability.
