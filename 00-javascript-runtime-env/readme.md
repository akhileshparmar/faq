# JavaScript Runtime Environment

A JavaScript runtime environment allows JavaScript code to be executed outside of a web browser. It provides the necessary components and libraries to run JavaScript on a server, desktop, or embedded device. Here are some key components and popular runtime environments:

### Key Components of a JavaScript Runtime Environment

1. **JavaScript Engine**: The core component that interprets and executes JavaScript code. Examples include V8 (used by Node.js and Chrome), SpiderMonkey (used by Firefox), and JavaScriptCore (used by Safari).

2. **Event Loop**: Manages asynchronous operations by handling events and callbacks.

3. **Standard Libraries**: Provide built-in functionalities for common tasks such as file I/O, networking, and cryptography.

4. **Module System**: Allows code to be organized into reusable modules.

### Popular JavaScript Runtime Environments

1. **Node.js**

   - **Engine**: V8
   - **Features**: Non-blocking, event-driven architecture; built-in modules for file system, HTTP, etc.; npm package manager.
   - **Use Cases**: Server-side applications, command-line tools, real-time applications.

2. **Deno**
   - **Engine**: V8
   - **Features**: Secure by default with permission controls; built-in TypeScript support; modern standard library.
