# **SSL and TLS: An Overview**

**SSL (Secure Sockets Layer)** and **TLS (Transport Layer Security)** are cryptographic protocols used to secure communication over the internet. They ensure **privacy**, **data integrity**, and **authentication** between two systems (e.g., a browser and a server).

### **Key Differences Between SSL and TLS**

1. **SSL**:

   - Older and less secure.
   - Versions: SSL 2.0, SSL 3.0 (deprecated as of 2015).
   - Replaced by TLS due to security vulnerabilities.

2. **TLS**:
   - Modern and more secure protocol.
   - Versions: TLS 1.0, TLS 1.1 (deprecated), TLS 1.2, and TLS 1.3 (current and most secure).
   - Backward-compatible with SSL in some configurations.

### **How SSL/TLS Works**

SSL/TLS establishes a **secure connection** through the following steps:

1. **Handshake**:

   - The client (e.g., a browser) and server agree on the encryption protocols.
   - The server provides its SSL/TLS certificate, proving its identity.

2. **Key Exchange**:

   - Securely exchange encryption keys using public-key cryptography (e.g., RSA, ECDHE).

3. **Data Encryption**:

   - Once the handshake is complete, data is encrypted using symmetric key encryption (faster than public-key cryptography).

4. **Data Integrity**:
   - Ensures that transmitted data is not tampered with during transit using message authentication codes (MACs).

### **Why Use SSL/TLS?**

1. **Encryption**: Protects sensitive information (e.g., passwords, credit card numbers).
2. **Authentication**: Verifies the identity of the server using certificates.
3. **Data Integrity**: Ensures that transmitted data has not been altered.

### **TLS/SSL Certificates**

- Digital certificates are issued by a **Certificate Authority (CA)** to verify the server's identity.
- Common types of certificates:
  - **Domain Validation (DV)**: Validates ownership of the domain.
  - **Organization Validation (OV)**: Confirms organization identity.
  - **Extended Validation (EV)**: Provides the highest level of trust.

### **Common Use Cases**

1. **Websites**: HTTPS (HTTP + TLS/SSL) for secure web browsing.
2. **Email**: Secure email protocols (e.g., IMAPS, SMTPS).
3. **VPNs**: Secure tunneling.
4. **VoIP**: Encrypt voice communication.

### **TLS vs. SSL: Why TLS is Preferred**

- **Improved Security**: TLS fixes known vulnerabilities in SSL.
- **Better Performance**: TLS has optimizations for faster connections.
- **Active Support**: SSL is outdated and no longer maintained.
