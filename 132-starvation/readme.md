# What is Starvation?

Starvation is a situation in concurrent programming and database management where a process or thread is perpetually denied access to resources or is unable to proceed because other processes or threads are continuously being given priority. As a result, the starved process remains waiting indefinitely, unable to make progress.

#### Example Scenario

Consider a scheduling algorithm where high-priority tasks continually preempt lower-priority tasks. If a low-priority task is never given CPU time because high-priority tasks keep arriving, the low-priority task experiences starvation.

### How to Prevent Starvation

To prevent starvation, you can employ several strategies:

1. **Fair Scheduling:**

   - **Round-Robin Scheduling:**
     - Each process or thread is given a fixed time slice in a circular order. This ensures that all tasks get a chance to execute.
   - **Fair Queues:**
     - Implement fair queuing mechanisms that allocate resources based on fairness and prioritize tasks that have been waiting the longest.

2. **Priority Aging:**

   - **Dynamic Priority Adjustment:**
     - Gradually increase the priority of tasks that have been waiting for a long time. This ensures that even tasks with initially low priority will eventually get a chance to execute.

3. **Time Limits:**

   - **Timeouts:**
     - Implement timeouts for resource requests. If a process waits beyond a certain period, it is either granted access or given a chance to retry.

4. **Resource Allocation Policies:**

   - **Resource Allocation Algorithms:**
     - Use algorithms designed to prevent starvation, such as the Banker's algorithm, which ensures that resources are allocated in a way that avoids indefinite postponement of requests.

5. **Concurrency Control:**
   - **Deadlock and Livelock Prevention:**
     - While not directly related, proper handling of deadlocks and livelocks can also help reduce the chances of starvation, as these issues can exacerbate starvation conditions.

### Starvation Prevention in MongoDB

In MongoDB, starvation is less of a direct concern compared to other systems due to its architecture. However, understanding how to manage locks and resource usage can help prevent situations that could lead to starvation:

1. **Optimize Queries:**

   - Ensure that queries are optimized to minimize their duration and reduce the impact on other operations. Long-running queries can cause lock contention.

2. **Use Indexes:**

   - Proper indexing can speed up queries and reduce the amount of time locks are held, thereby reducing the potential for starvation.

3. **Design Schema Efficiently:**

   - Design your schema to avoid long-running operations on heavily accessed collections or documents.

4. **Monitor and Adjust:**
   - Regularly monitor database performance and adjust resource allocation as needed to ensure fair access and prevent bottlenecks.

### Summary

Starvation is a critical issue where a process or thread is unable to proceed due to continuous denial of resources. To prevent starvation, employ fair scheduling algorithms, priority aging, and proper resource allocation policies. In MongoDB, optimizing queries, using indexes, and designing schemas efficiently can help mitigate conditions that could lead to starvation.
