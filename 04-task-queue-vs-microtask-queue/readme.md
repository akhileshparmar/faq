# Task queue vs Microtask queue

In the context of the JavaScript event loop, **task queues** and **microtask queues** are mechanisms that manage the execution of asynchronous operations and their callbacks. They help ensure that asynchronous tasks and events are processed in a specific order. Here's a detailed explanation:

## Task Queue

The **task queue** (or callback queue) is where callbacks from asynchronous operations like timers, I/O operations, and events are placed when they are ready to be executed.

#### Characteristics:

- **Tasks**: Includes callbacks from functions like `setTimeout`, `setInterval`, and event listeners.
- **Processing**: After the call stack is empty, the event loop will pick tasks from the task queue and push them onto the call stack for execution.
- **Execution Order**: Tasks are executed in the order they are added to the queue. Once a task is being executed, it runs to completion before the next task is picked up.

## Microtask Queue

The **microtask queue** (or job queue) is used for tasks that need to be executed as soon as possible after the currently executing script has finished, but before the event loop moves on to the next task in the task queue. It is often used for promise callbacks and mutation observers.

#### Characteristics:

- **Microtasks**: Includes promise callbacks (`then`, `catch`, `finally`), `MutationObserver` callbacks, and some other operations that need to be processed immediately.
- **Processing**: After each task from the task queue is executed, the event loop processes all microtasks in the microtask queue before moving to the next task.
- **Execution Order**: Microtasks are processed in the order they are added, and they run to completion before any tasks from the task queue are executed.

### Execution Flow

To illustrate the interaction between the task queue and microtask queue:

1. **Synchronous Code Execution**: Executes immediately and is placed in the call stack.
2. **Microtasks**: After the synchronous code execution completes, the event loop processes all microtasks from the microtask queue before moving on to the task queue.
3. **Tasks**: The event loop then picks tasks from the task queue and executes them, in the order they were added.

### Summary

- **Task Queue**: Contains tasks from asynchronous operations like `setTimeout` and event handlers. Tasks are processed in order, but only after all microtasks are completed.
- **Microtask Queue**: Contains tasks that need to be executed immediately after the current script has finished but before any other tasks. It handles promise callbacks and other high-priority tasks.

Understanding the distinction between these queues helps in managing the execution order of asynchronous operations and can aid in debugging issues related to timing and order of operations in JavaScript code.
