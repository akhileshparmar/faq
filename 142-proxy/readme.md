# Proxy

A proxy is an intermediary that acts as a gateway between a user and the internet. It can serve various purposes depending on the context:

1. **Network Proxy:** In a computer network, a proxy server is a device or software that forwards requests from clients (like web browsers) to other servers. This can help with security, load balancing, and caching.

2. **Web Proxy:** Specifically for web traffic, a web proxy allows users to access websites through it, which can help with privacy, bypassing geo-restrictions, and filtering content.

3. **Proxy in Computing:** In programming, a proxy can be a class or object that represents another object. It can control access, manage requests, or provide additional functionality.

4. **Proxy in Business:** A proxy can also refer to an individual authorized to act on someone else's behalf in business settings, like voting in shareholder meetings.

Overall, proxies are used to improve performance, enhance security, or provide functionality that might not be directly available.

A **forward proxy** and a **reverse proxy** are both types of proxy servers, but they serve different purposes and are used in different contexts. Here's a comparison between the two:

### Forward Proxy

- **Purpose**: A forward proxy acts on behalf of clients (like users or devices) to access resources on the internet.
- **Client-Side Use**: The client sends requests to the forward proxy, which then forwards those requests to the destination server (e.g., a website). The server’s response is then sent back to the proxy, which passes it to the client.
- **Common Use Cases**:
  - **Anonymity**: Hides the client’s IP address when browsing the internet.
  - **Content Filtering**: Blocks access to certain websites or content (e.g., in schools or workplaces).
  - **Access Control**: Restricts internet access based on policies.
  - **Caching**: Reduces bandwidth usage by caching frequently accessed data.
- **Example**: A company uses a forward proxy to allow employees to access the internet. The proxy filters out unwanted websites and logs internet usage.

### Reverse Proxy

- **Purpose**: A reverse proxy acts on behalf of servers, intercepting requests from clients and forwarding them to the appropriate server within the internal network.
- **Server-Side Use**: Clients are unaware that they are interacting with a reverse proxy. They send requests to what appears to be the actual server, but the reverse proxy receives the request and decides which server in the backend should handle it.
- **Common Use Cases**:
  - **Load Balancing**: Distributes client requests across multiple servers to balance the load and prevent any single server from becoming overwhelmed.
  - **Security**: Protects internal servers by hiding their identity and details from the client. It can also act as a firewall to filter malicious requests.
  - **SSL Termination**: Manages SSL encryption/decryption, reducing the load on the backend servers.
  - **Caching**: Serves cached responses to clients, improving performance.
- **Example**: A website with high traffic uses a reverse proxy to distribute incoming requests across multiple servers, ensuring that no single server is overloaded and that the site remains responsive.

### Key Differences:

- **Direction**:
  - **Forward Proxy**: Sits between the client and the internet, working on behalf of the client.
  - **Reverse Proxy**: Sits between the client and the server, working on behalf of the server.
- **Visibility**:
  - **Forward Proxy**: The client knows it's using a proxy.
  - **Reverse Proxy**: The client interacts with what it perceives as the original server, unaware of the proxy.
- **Primary Role**:
  - **Forward Proxy**: Primarily used for client-side activities (e.g., privacy, access control).
  - **Reverse Proxy**: Primarily used for server-side management (e.g., load balancing, security).

### In Short

- A **forward proxy** is like a middleman for users trying to access the internet. It helps users hide their identity, block certain websites, or speed up access to frequently visited sites by caching them. Users know they are using a proxy.

  **Forward Proxy**: Set up by the **client** (or on the client’s network) to manage and control outgoing requests to the internet. For example, a company might set up a forward proxy to filter and monitor employee internet usage.

- A **reverse proxy** is like a middleman for servers. It helps manage incoming requests, like distributing them across multiple servers to balance the load, adding security, and handling encrypted traffic. Users don't know they're interacting with a proxy; they think they're directly connecting to the server.

  **Reverse Proxy**: Set up by the **server** (or on the server’s network) to manage and control incoming requests from the internet. For example, a website might use a reverse proxy to distribute traffic across several servers, improving performance and security.

- A forward proxy is there to protect clients, while a reverse proxy is there to protect servers.

### Here's a comparison between Forward Proxy and Reverse Proxy:

| **Aspect**             | **Forward Proxy Server**                    | **Reverse Proxy Server**                             |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| **Responsibility**     | Handles outgoing requests from clients      | Handles incoming requests from clients               |
| **Representation**     | Represents clients to the internet          | Represents servers to clients                        |
| **Anonymity**          | Provides client anonymity                   | Provides server anonymity                            |
| **Privacy & Control**  | Enhances client privacy and content control | Functions as a load balancer and protects the server |
| **Infrastructure**     | Part of client-side infrastructure          | Part of server-side infrastructure                   |
| **Potential Concerns** | Can be misused and may impact performance   | Adds complexity and can be a single point of failure |
| **Examples**           | PHP-Proxy, Squid, CGI-Proxy                 | NGINX, HAProxy, Linkerd, Istio                       |

This table concisely presents the key differences between forward and reverse proxies.
