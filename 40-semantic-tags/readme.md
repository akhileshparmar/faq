# semantic tags

Semantic tags in HTML are elements that clearly describe their meaning in a human- and machine-readable way. These tags define the purpose of the content they enclose, making it easier for browsers, search engines, and developers to understand the structure and importance of the content. Using semantic tags improves the accessibility and SEO (Search Engine Optimization) of web pages.

### Benefits of Using Semantic Tags

1. **Accessibility**: Screen readers and other assistive technologies can better interpret the structure and content of a web page, making it more accessible to users with disabilities.
2. **SEO**: Search engines can more accurately index and rank web pages by understanding the context and importance of content.
3. **Code Readability**: Developers can more easily read and maintain code that is clearly structured and meaningful.
4. **Future-Proofing**: As web standards evolve, semantic HTML ensures better compatibility and support with future technologies and browsers.

Here's a list of semantic HTML5 tags in tabular form, along with a brief description of each:
