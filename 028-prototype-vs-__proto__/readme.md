# Prototype vs `__proto__`

`Object.prototype` and `object.__proto__` are both related to the prototype chain in JavaScript, but they serve different purposes and have distinct characteristics. Here's a detailed comparison of the two:

### `Object.prototype`

- **Definition**: `Object.prototype` is a built-in object that is the prototype of all objects created using the `Object` constructor or object literals.
- **Role in Prototype Chain**: It is the top of the prototype chain. All objects inherit properties and methods from `Object.prototype` unless explicitly specified otherwise.
- **Properties and Methods**: It contains methods like `hasOwnProperty`, `isPrototypeOf`, `propertyIsEnumerable`, and others that are available to all objects unless overridden.
- **Immutability**: The prototype of `Object.prototype` is `null`, and this prototype linkage cannot be changed.

### Example

```javascript
console.log(Object.prototype); // Outputs: {}
console.log(Object.prototype.__proto__); // Outputs: null
```

### `object.__proto__`

- **Definition**: `__proto__` is an accessor property on every object that provides a way to access or set the object's prototype (i.e., the internal `[[Prototype]]` property).
- **Role in Prototype Chain**: It allows dynamic access to the prototype of an object and can be used to traverse or modify the prototype chain.
- **Properties and Methods**: It does not directly contain properties or methods, but it points to the prototype object, which does.
- **Legacy and Modern Alternatives**: `__proto__` is considered a legacy feature. The recommended methods are `Object.getPrototypeOf` to get the prototype and `Object.setPrototypeOf` to set the prototype.

### Example

```javascript
let obj = {};
console.log(obj.__proto__); // Outputs: Object.prototype
```

### Key Differences

1. **Usage**:

   - `Object.prototype` is the prototype from which all standard objects inherit properties and methods.
   - `object.__proto__` is a way to access or modify the prototype of a specific object.

2. **Context**:

   - `Object.prototype` is a property of the `Object` constructor itself.
   - `__proto__` is a property of instances of objects.

3. **Mutability**:

   - The prototype of `Object.prototype` is `null` and immutable.
   - The `__proto__` property can be used to dynamically change the prototype of an object, though this practice is generally discouraged.

4. **Legacy vs. Modern**:
   - `Object.prototype` is part of the core JavaScript language and widely used.
   - `__proto__` is a legacy feature with modern alternatives like `Object.getPrototypeOf` and `Object.setPrototypeOf`.

### Practical Example

```javascript
// Object.prototype
console.log(Object.prototype); // Outputs the Object prototype

// Creating an object and checking its prototype
let myObject = {};
console.log(myObject.__proto__); // Outputs: Object.prototype

// Changing the prototype of an object
let newProto = { customProperty: "value" };
myObject.__proto__ = newProto;
console.log(myObject.customProperty); // Outputs: 'value'
```

In summary, `Object.prototype` is the fundamental prototype object from which all standard objects inherit, whereas `__proto__` is an instance property that provides a way to access or modify an object's prototype dynamically.
